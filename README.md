# SignPlayer
SignPlayer project by team Allies for Amazon Teckathon 2022

How to run the website:
1- In Django project you need to download (django, django_rest_framework, corsheaders, etc) modules.
2- In Flask project you need to download (flask, textblob, youtube_transcript_api, etc) modules.
3- In React project you need to download node modules by typing (npm i) and install reactjs.

then run django project by using (python manage.py runserver) / to access database add /api/items/ to link
then run flask project by click (run) in code editor
then run reactjs app by typing (npm start)

if you face any problem make sure that you have downloaded every modules and django local server run into http://127.0.0.1:8000/ port {you can change
it from react app/src/Video.js - 14th line} and flask local server run into http://127.0.0.1:5000/ port {you can change
it from react app/src/IFrame.js - 4th line}
