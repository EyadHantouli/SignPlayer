Unfortunately we weren’t able to  commit during the first 2 days were we got about 90% of the work done …this unfortunate event happened due
to the fact that the team member who was responsible for half of the missions including the uploading had called in sick and had to check in to a hospital for treatment …
this also had various effects on out project in overall as we had to skip some details here and there …we hope you understand.
